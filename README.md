# SplitBill — Stellar Soroban dApp

**SplitBill** is a group expense tracker built on a smart contract deployed to **Stellar Soroban** (Testnet). Each group member pays their share of a bill *on-chain*, with payment status, group ownership, and activity history that are transparent and directly verifiable on the blockchain.

🌐 **Live demo:** [stellar-meetup.vercel.app](https://stellar-meetup.vercel.app/)

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-wallet support** — via [Stellar Wallets Kit](https://github.com/Creit-Tech/Stellar-Wallets-Kit) (Freighter, Albedo, xBull, LOBSTR, Rabet)
- **Smart contract** for:
  - Creating a group (`create_group`)
  - Renaming a group (`update_group`) — owner only
  - Deleting a group (`delete_group`) — owner only
  - Adding a member with their bill share (`add_member`)
  - Paying a share on-chain (`pay_share`)
  - Escrow settlement (`settle_group`) — funds held in the contract until all members have paid, then withdrawn by the owner in one transaction
- **Sequential group IDs** — each new group gets an auto-incrementing ID (1, 2, 3, …), avoiding precision-loss issues with large random IDs
- **Two-layer error handling**:
  - *Wallet-level*: not found, rejected, insufficient balance
  - *Contract-level*: `AlreadyPaid`, `NotAMember`, `IncorrectAmount`, `GroupNotFound`, `NotOwner`
- **Full page set**: Dashboard (statistics), Groups (search & filter), Group Detail (manage members, pay, edit/delete, settle), Activity (history feed)
- **Modern UI** — dark mode, responsive, accessible

> **Note:** `contracts/notes/` is a separate contract from earlier learning exercises and is not part of the SplitBill application — only `contracts/splitbill/` is deployed and used by the frontend. The `CreateGroup.tsx` / `AddMember.tsx` / `PayShare.tsx` components are earlier, simpler versions kept in the repo for reference; the app currently uses their `*Modal.tsx` counterparts.

## 🚀 Setup & Running

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) with the `wasm32v1-none` target
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/install-cli)
- Node.js (v18+) and npm
- A Stellar wallet extension (e.g. [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app))

### 1. Clone & build the contract

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd <REPO_NAME>/contracts/splitbill
cargo test
stellar contract build
```

### 2. Deploy to testnet (optional — already deployed, see address below)

```bash
stellar keys generate alice --network testnet --fund
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/splitbill.wasm \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet
```

> **Note:** after redeploying, update `CONTRACT_ID` in `frontend/src/lib/contract.ts`.

### 3. Run the frontend

```bash
cd ../../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, or try the [live demo](https://stellar-meetup.vercel.app).

### 4. Connect a wallet

- Install a wallet extension and set its network to **Testnet**.
- Click **Connect Wallet** in the app and choose a wallet.
- If the account has no testnet balance, top up via [Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org).
